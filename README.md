# portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of editorial designs that I have made during my university years from both the academic and non-academic sectors.

The first file (boot) is a booklet of object-oriented programming assignments. This booklet contains an explanation of the use of the program for users in detail and also the process of making programs carried out in groups.

The second file (lambodara) is a magazine project from my student activity unit (ukm) on campus. I am the publishing manager of this magazine as well as the main designer of this magazine. All the news in it is related to the campus and its students.
